# Technologies Used 
BudgetMonkey was created using the MERN stack. 

It operates using a MongoDB database, with the backend created in Express.js. For authentication, a Passport.js local-strategy was used, along with passport.session and express.session to maintain a logged in state after the tab is closed. Bcyrpt was used for password encryption.

The frontend was created in React, using a combination of Bootstraps column system and MaterialUI's Grid system.
